setting up asus rog
====================

  Installation
  -------------
		pacman -S linux-firmware

	g14 repo contains all the tools you need on a ROG laptop precompiled for you. 
	g14 is only a name and all tools from it apply to most ROG laptops Before adding 
	the repo you need to add the repo sign key to your pacman-key. Run the following 
	commands to add it:

		pacman-key --recv-keys 8F654886F17D497FEFE3DB448B15A6B0E9A3FA35
		pacman-key --finger 8F654886F17D497FEFE3DB448B15A6B0E9A3FA35
		pacman-key --lsign-key 8F654886F17D497FEFE3DB448B15A6B0E9A3FA35
		pacman-key --finger 8F654886F17D497FEFE3DB448B15A6B0E9A3FA35

	After that to get the repo add to your /etc/pacman.conf at the end:
	
		[g14]
		Server = https://arch.asus-linux.org

	After adding the repo run a full system update before you go to install tools from the repo:

		pacman -Suy

  Asusctl - custom fan profiles, anime, led control etc.
  ------------------------------------------------------

	The recommended way to install asusctl is using g14 pacman repo. Packages like asusctl-git 
	rom AUR aren't supported. Also installing manually from cloned git isn't supported. For 
	nstalling it run:

		pacman -S asusctl power-profiles-daemon

	asusd service is triggered by a udev rule after the keyboard driver is ready, the service 
	doesn't need to be enabled and is not supposed  to be.
	power-profiles-daemon is optional but highly recommend, other power management tools can 
	create conflicts with asusctl or supergfxctl.

		systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon.service

  ROG Control Center
  ------------------

	ROG Control Center is a GUI tool for configuring few aspects of asusctl and supergfxctl. 
	It was previously part of the asusctl package, but has now been separated as its own package 
	in G14 repo. After adding the repo to /etc/pacman.conf as stated above, then you can install
	the tool:

		pacman -S rog-control-center

	
  Custom kernel - drivers fixes, hardware support
  -----------------------------------------------

	Newer devices often require custom kernel with patches, that kernel is also available in the
	g14 pacman repo, to install it just run:

		pacman -Sy linux-g14 linux-g14-headers

	After installing the new kernel you need to regenerate your boot menu or add a new boot entry 
	depending on what boot manager you are using. For GRUB that will be:

		grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
